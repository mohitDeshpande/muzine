                <h1>Drake</h1>
                <p>Famed hip-hop artist Drake was born to a mixed-race couple in Canada in 1986, and raised Jewish.
                    He came to fame playing wheelchair-bound Jimmy Brooks in seven seasons of the popular teen soap Degrassi: The Next Generation.
                    In 2006, Drake began circulating mixtapes of his raps, and signed a record deal in 2009. His hit songs include "Every Girl," "Best I Ever Had,"
                    "Money to Blow" and "Take Care."</p>
                <p class="show-more">Drake was a cross-platform cultural phenomenon in the 2010s. The songwriter, producer, rapper, and singer sustained a high-level commercial presence shortly after he turned to rapping in 2006, whether on his own chart-topping releases or through a long string of guest appearances on hits by the likes of Lil Wayne, Rihanna, and A$AP Rocky. Each one of the former child actor's first four proper albums, as well as a 2015 mixtape, topped the album charts in his native Canada and in the U.S. Though he caroused with his most hedonistic contemporaries, Drake was frequently praised for his sensitive, introspective approach to rap and R&B.
                    Known initially for his role as Jimmy Brooks on Degrassi: The Next Generation, the Toronto, Ontario-born Aubrey Drake Graham stepped out as a rapper and singer with pop appeal in 2006, when he initiated a series of mixtapes. A year later, despite being unsigned, he scored major exposure when his cocky and laid-back track "Replacement Girl," featuring Trey Songz, was featured on BET's 106 & Park program as its "Joint of the Day." He raised his profile throughout the next several months by popping up on countless mixtapes and remixes, and as rumors swirled about contract offers from labels, he gradually became one of the most talked-about artists in the industry. It did not hurt that he had support from the likes of Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Lil Wayne.
                    By the end of June 2009, "Best I Ever Had," a promotional single, had climbed to number two on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. After a fierce bidding war, Drake signed with Universal Motown in late summer and released an EP (So Far Gone) made up of songs from his popular So Far Gone mixtape. It peaked at number six on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and won a 2010 Juno Award for Rap Recording of the Year. Thank Me Later, a full-length featuring collaborations with the Kings of Leon, the-Dream, Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Lil Wayne, was issued through Young Money in June 2010. It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Still, the artist felt his debut was rushed, so its follow-up arrived in November 2015 with the title Take Care, referencing the increased time and effort put into the album's creation. Receiving critical acclaim, Grammy Awards, and the number one slot on the U.S. Billboard 200, Take Care cemented Drake's place as one of Canada's biggest exports.
                    In 2012, while on tour, Drake announced that he had started work on what would be his third studio album. Nothing Was the Same was released the following September. It spawned many singles, topped charts around the world, was shortlisted for the Polaris Music Prize, and was nominated for a Best Rap Album Grammy. Soon after the album's release, he hit the road on an extended tour, took part in some collaborations, and released a few singles, including the Grammy-nominated "0 to 100/The Catch Up." His next release was planned as a free mixtape before Cash Money decided they would rather charge for it. The decidedly downbeat If You're Reading This It's Too Late was released in February 2015 and debuted at number one, while all 17 of its songs entered the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.
                    In late summer 2015, he dropped a trio of new tracks on his Soundcloud page. One of them, the Timmy Thomas-sampling "Hotline Bling,"
                    became a Top Five pop hit in Canada and the U.S. and something of a cultural phenomenon. Later that year, Drake hit the studio with Future
                    for a six-day session that yielded the mixtape What a Time to Be Alive. Upon the album's September release, it became Drake's second recording
                    of the year to debut at number one. After dropping three singles in the beginning months of 2016, Drake's fourth album, Views, was released in
                    April and debuted at number one. It revolved lyrically around his hometown Toronto and featured production by longtime cohorts Noah "40" Shebib
                    and Boi-1da, among others. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi</p>

                <h1>Lana Del Rey</h1>
                <p>Lana Del Rey envisioned a Southern Californian dream world constructed out of sad girls and bad boys, manufactured melancholy and genuine glamour, and then she came to embody this fantasy. At first, her stylized noir-pop garnered skeptical sneers -- the rise of her 2012 debut Born to Die was impeded by a tentative live debut on Saturday Night Live -- but Lana Del Rey proved to be tougher than her soft exterior suggested. Following a hit remix of her single "Summertime Sadness," she steadily gained not only popularity but respect, with her 2014 second album Ultraviolence receiving positive reviews to accompany her sales; her imitators, of which there were many, were merely an alluring accessory. By that point, Lana Del Rey had become the ideal she intended to be: a damaged torch singer designed as the tragic romantic icon for her age. </p>
                <p class="show-more">Lana Del Rey's journey to this stardom was a long, steady climb. Born as Elizabeth Woolridge Grant in New York City to a pair of wealthy parents, she was raised in Lake Placid, not starting to pursue music until she was out of high school and living with her aunt and uncle on Long Island. Her uncle taught her how to play guitar and soon she was writing songs and playing New York clubs, sometimes under the name Lizzy Grant. While she attended Fordham University, she continued to play music and she started getting serious around 2005. In April of that year, a CD of originals was registered under her birth name with the U.S. Copyright Office and she recorded elsewhere, finishing up an unreleased folky album called Sirens under the name May Jailer. Reverting to the name Lizzy Grant, she signed with 5 Points Records in 2006, recording an EP called Kill Kill with producer David Kahne, who would prove to be her first pivotal collaborator. Kill Kill appeared digitally in 2008 and over the next two years Grant became Lana Del Rey, digitally releasing a full self-titled album under that name in 2010. Not long after its release, she teamed with managers Ben Mawson and Ed Millett, who helped her separate from 5 Points (rights to her recordings reverted back to her) and moved to England, where she began crafting the Lana Del Rey persona.
                    The first unveiling of Lana Del Rey arrived in 2011 via YouTube videos that quickly became a viral sensation, led by the moody, murky "Video Games" and followed by "Blue Jeans." Much of her success was limited to the Internet but it soon started to spill over into the pop culture of the U.K. By the fall of that year, she released "Video Games" on Stranger Records, an independent division of Interscope/Polydor, in the U.K. and she won the Next Big Thing trophy at the Q Awards. Lana Del Rey's full-fledged debut album, Born to Die, appeared to considerable anticipation in January 2012. Greeted to mixed reviews, Born to Die's launch also suffered a setback after LDR's halting appearance on Saturday Night Live on January 14, 2012 but that apparent stumble ultimately had the effect of raising Lana Del Rey's profile and soon Born to Die became a steady seller. That November, LDR released the Paradise EP -- at eight tracks and 33 minutes, it was essentially a mini-LP; some pressings bundled Paradise with Born to Die -- which, supported by the single "Ride," charted at ten in the U.S.
                    Throughout 2013, various singles and videos surfaced -- these included a cover of Leonard Cohen's "Chelsea Hotel #2," as well as a cover of Lee Hazlewood's "Summer Wine" performed with her then-boyfriend Barrie-James O'Neill -- but her biggest release of the year was the new song "Young and Beautiful," penned for Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of The Great Gatsby. Ultimately, this single was overshadowed by Cedric Gervais' remix of Born to Die's "Summertime Sadness," a remix that turned the song into her first Top Ten hit in the U.S. At the end of 2013, Lana Del Rey released a short film called Tropico, which was accompanied by an EP of the same name. All of these releases -- including a cover of the Disney standard "Once Upon a Dream" for the Disney film Maleficent -- kept LDR in the spotlight as she worked on her second album. Lana Del Rey hired Dan Auerbach, the leader of Ohio blues-rockers the Black Keys, to produce the majority of Ultraviolence, the sophomore set that appeared in June 2014, preceded by the singles "West Coast," "Shades of Cool," "Ultraviolence," and "Brooklyn Baby." Ultraviolence found a more receptive initial audience than Born to Die: not only were the reviews positive, so were the sales, with the album debuting at number one in both the U.S. and the U.K. Ultimately, Ultraviolence didn't generate hits as big as Born to Die but it performed the crucial task of elevating Lana Del Rey's critical reputation, illustrated by her selection to sing the title song for Tim Burton's 2014 bid for an Oscar, Big Eyes.
                    Lana Del Rey wasted no time following Ultraviolence. During the first months of 2015, she worked on a third full-length album and announced a co-headlining summer 2015 tour with Courtney Love. As the summer wound to a close, Lana Del Rey announced the September release of Honeymoon, an album she said is "very different from the last one and similar to the first two, Born to Die and Paradise." Her claim was borne out by the album's first two singles, "High by the Beach" and "Terrence Loves You." Honeymoon saw release on September 18, 2015. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi</p>

                <h1>Kanye West</h1>
                <p>Kanye West is full of contradictions: He's arrogant but self-deprecating, materialistic but religious, remarkably rude but also sensitive.
                    Rather than sublimate those conflicts, his music shows them off. By melding the gangsta ethos with his own nerdy persona and making hip-hop that was
                    at once deeply introspective, utterly distinct, and lots of fun, West became the most important new pop star of the 2000s — a character who made
                    the mainstream come to him, rather than the other way around.</p><br>
                <p class="show-more">West was born in Atlanta to Ray West, a photojournalist, ex-Black Panther and counselor, and Donda West, an academic. The couple divorced when Kanye was three, and Donda raised him during school years in Chicago's South Shore suburb. Kanye spent a year in college but dropped out to pursue a musical career. He began making hip-hop beats for local acts before moving on to placing tracks on Top Ten albums by Jermaine Dupri, Foxy Brown, and Lil' Kim.
                <br><br>
                    West's big break came when he put together the beat for Jay-Z's "This Can't Be Life," from the Roc-a-Fella co-founder's 2000 The Dynasty: Roc la Familia album. The following year, he handled production on a third of the 15 tracks on Jay-Z's The Blueprint (2001, Number One), including the smash "Izzo (H.O.V.A.)" (2001, Number Eight) and the Nas dis track, "Takeover."
                <br><br>
                    West's hot streak as a producer continued apace with his "chipmunk soul" style—sped-up vocal snippets of old R&B records—inspired, according to West, by the RZA's production for the Wu-Tang Clan and their associates. His signature sound helped make him one of the most in-demand producers. In the two-and-a-half years between The Blueprint and his own debut, West contributed tracks to two-dozen albums, among them: Cam'ron's Come Home with Me (2002), Talib Kweli's Quality (2002), Nas's The Lost Tapes (2002), T.I.'s Trap Muzik (2003), Beyonce's Dangerously in Love (2003), Ludacris's Chicken-N-Beer (2003), The Diary of Alicia Keys (2003), and Jay-Z's The Blueprint 2.0: The Gift and the Curse (Number One, 2002) and The Black Album (Number One, 2003).
                <br><br>
                    West garnered headlines in early 2006, when he appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone wearing a crown of thorns in a shot inspired by the Martin Scorsese film The Last Temptation of Christ. After concentrating on producing albums by John Legend (Once Again) and Common (Finding Forever), live performance (with a DJ, live drummer, backing singers, and string section accompanying him), West announced his third album, Graduation, would be issued September 11, 2007—the same date as 50 Cent's Curtis, prompting a rivalry between the MCs, and landing West another Rolling Stone cover, this one opposite 50.
                <br><br>
                    In September, 2009, West proved that there would be no stop to the controversies when he bound onstage while Taylor Swift was accepting the award for Best Female Video, snatched the mic from her hand, and declared that Beyonce she should have won. He later called Swift to apologize and she accepted, but the incident seemed to fit right into the fascinating persona that will likely continue to draw our collective attention for years to come.
